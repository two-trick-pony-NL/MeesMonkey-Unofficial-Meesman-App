# Unofficial Meesman App 
This is the repository for my unofficial version of a App for Meesman Indexbeleggen. Meesman does not offer a app of their own and thus I decided to build one. 
I use a custom API endpoint that I also build by scraping mijn.meesman.nl, check the API here: https://github.com/two-trick-pony-NL/MeesmanAPI

# App
The app is built using Expo (react native) and should work on both Android and iOS. However I only tested on iOS. 

# Known shortcomings:
- If you have multiple accounts with meesman it only shows data for the first one.
